    "Flask is a popular web framework for building web applications in Python. It is a lightweight and flexible framework that follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Flask provides a simple and intuitive way to develop web applications by providing tools and libraries for handling routing, request handling, template rendering, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Lightweight and Minimalistic: Flask is designed to be minimalistic, which means it provides only the essential tools needed for web development. This makes it lightweight and easy to understand, allowing developers to have more control over their application's structure and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Flexibility: Flask provides a lot of flexibility, allowing developers to customize and choose the components they need for their application. It does not enforce any specific way of doing things, so developers have the freedom to structure their code as they prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Easy to Get Started: Flask has a simple and straightforward syntax, making it easy for beginners to get started with web development. The learning curve is relatively low compared to other web frameworks, which means developers can start building applications quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Extensible: Flask is highly extensible, allowing developers to add additional functionality through various Flask extensions. There are numerous extensions available for tasks like database integration, authentication, form handling, and more. This extensibility makes it easier to integrate Flask with other libraries and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Large and Active Community: Flask has a large and active community of developers, which means there are plenty of resources, tutorials, and documentation available. This community support makes it easier to find help and learn from others' experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Well-Documented: Flask has excellent documentation that covers all the aspects of the framework. The documentation provides clear explanations, examples, and code snippets, making it easier for developers to understand and use Flask effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Scalability: While Flask is often used for small to medium-sized applications, it can also scale well for larger projects. By leveraging extensions and adopting proper design patterns, Flask can handle complex and scalable web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask's simplicity, flexibility, and extensibility make it a popular choice for developers who value control over their web application's structure and functionality."

    "2.Page navigation: By defining routes, we can create multiple pages within our Flask application and navigate between them using different URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Dynamic content: Routes enable us to create dynamic web applications where the content of a page can vary based on user input or other factors. Different routes can handle different types of requests and return appropriate responses.\n",
